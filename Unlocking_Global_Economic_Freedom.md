# Bitcoin and Freedom

## 1. Introduction  
Economic freedom is the ability of individuals to control their own financial resources, trade freely, and access stable monetary systems without undue interference. Historically, traditional financial institutions and centralized monetary policies have imposed restrictions, limiting economic opportunities for billions of people.  

Bitcoin, as a decentralized, borderless, and censorship-resistant financial system, offers a groundbreaking alternative. It empowers individuals by providing self-sovereign money that transcends government control, enhances financial inclusion, and protects wealth from inflationary policies.
