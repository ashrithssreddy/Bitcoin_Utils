# Crypto Essentials: A Practical Guide for Everyday Users

## Must Know

### 1. **Blockchain**
A **blockchain**, also known as a **distributed ledger**, is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a way that ensures transparency and security. Each transaction is grouped into a "block" and linked chronologically, forming a "chain" of records.

### 2. **Wallet**
A **crypto wallet** (also referred to as a **digital wallet**) is a tool used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrency. Wallets can either be software-based (such as mobile apps or desktop applications) or hardware-based (physical devices that store keys offline).

### 3. **Private Key**
A **private key** (sometimes called a **secret key** or **private code**) is a string of characters that acts like a password, giving you access to your cryptocurrency holdings. Losing or sharing this key can result in losing control over your crypto, so it's crucial to keep it secure.

### 4. **Public Key**
A **public key** (or **wallet address**/**receiving address**) is like your account number. It is a string of characters that you can share with others to receive cryptocurrency.

### 5. **Exchange**
A **crypto exchange** (alternatively called a **trading platform**) is an online service where you can buy, sell, or trade cryptocurrencies. Popular exchanges include Binance, Coinbase, and ZebPay.

### 6. **Fiat Currency**
**Fiat currency** refers to traditional government-issued money like the US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), or Indian Rupee (INR). Fiat currencies have value because governments maintain them, while cryptocurrencies derive their value from supply, demand, and their underlying blockchain.

### 7. **Stablecoin**
A **stablecoin** (also known as a **pegged cryptocurrency**) is a type of cryptocurrency that has its value pegged to a more stable asset, like a fiat currency (e.g., USDC is pegged to USD). This reduces the volatility seen in other cryptocurrencies.

### 8. **Gas Fee**
A **gas fee** (also called a **transaction fee** or **network fee**) is a small fee paid to complete a transaction on the blockchain. For instance, on Ethereum, gas fees are used to compensate miners for processing transactions and securing the network.

### 9. **Transaction Hash (TxID)**
A **transaction hash** (also referred to as a **TxID** or **transaction ID**) is a unique identifier for a specific cryptocurrency transaction. It can be used to track the transaction’s status on a blockchain explorer.

### 10. **Seed Phrase**
A **seed phrase** (or **recovery phrase**/**backup phrase**) is a series of words generated when you set up a crypto wallet. This phrase can be used to restore access to your wallet if you lose it. It’s crucial to store your seed phrase securely and never share it with anyone.

### 11. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
**Two-factor authentication** (or **multi-factor authentication**) is a security feature that requires users to provide two forms of verification (e.g., a password and a code sent to your phone) to access their accounts, adding an extra layer of security.

## Good to Know

### 1. **Altcoin**
An **altcoin** (short for **alternative coin**) refers to any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. Examples include Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC).

### 2. **Cold Storage**
**Cold storage** (also referred to as **offline storage** or **hardware wallet storage**) is the practice of storing cryptocurrency in a wallet that is not connected to the internet, offering greater protection from hackers.

### 3. **Hot Wallet**
A **hot wallet** (also known as an **online wallet**) is a crypto wallet that is connected to the internet. Hot wallets are more convenient for frequent transactions but are also more vulnerable to hacking.

### 4. **Mining**
**Mining** (sometimes referred to as **Bitcoin mining** or **Proof of Work**) is the process of verifying and adding new transactions to a blockchain, typically through complex computational puzzles. Miners are rewarded with new coins for their efforts.

### 5. **Staking**
**Staking** (also known as **crypto staking** or **Proof of Stake**) is a way to participate in a blockchain network by locking up your cryptocurrency to help validate transactions. In return, you can earn rewards, similar to earning interest.

### 6. **Token**
A **token** (sometimes called a **crypto token** or **digital token**) is a type of cryptocurrency that represents an asset or utility, often built on top of existing blockchain platforms like Ethereum.

### 7. **ERC-20 Token**
An **ERC-20 token** is a technical standard used on the Ethereum blockchain for smart contracts and token creation. Many popular tokens, such as USDC, follow this standard.

### 8. **Proof of Work (PoW)**
**Proof of Work (PoW)** is a consensus algorithm used by blockchains like Bitcoin. Miners compete to solve complex math problems, and the first to solve it gets to add the block to the chain and is rewarded with cryptocurrency.

### 9. **Proof of Stake (PoS)**
**Proof of Stake (PoS)** is a consensus algorithm in which validators are chosen based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake." This method is more energy-efficient than Proof of Work.

### 10. **Smart Contract**
A **smart contract** (or **self-executing contract**) is a piece of code on the blockchain that automatically enforces the rules of a contract when certain conditions are met. Smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries.

## Great to Know

### 1. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**
**Decentralized finance** (often called **DeFi** or **open finance**) refers to financial services that are built on blockchain technology, enabling things like lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional intermediaries like banks.

### 2. **NFT (Non-Fungible Token)**
An **NFT** (or **digital collectible**/**unique token**) is a type of digital asset that represents ownership of a unique item, like art, music, or virtual real estate. NFTs are often traded on blockchain platforms like Ethereum.

### 3. **Fork**
A **fork** (or **blockchain fork**) occurs when a blockchain splits into two separate chains due to disagreements in the network’s rules. A famous example is the split between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, which created two separate blockchains.

### 4. **Liquidity**
**Liquidity** (also known as **market liquidity**) refers to how easily a cryptocurrency can be bought or sold without affecting its price. Highly liquid markets make transactions smoother.

### 5. **Dapp (Decentralized Application)**
A **Dapp** (short for **decentralized application**) is a software application that runs on a blockchain, such as Ethereum. Unlike traditional apps, Dapps are decentralized and don’t rely on a single server.

### 6. **Base Layer (Layer 1)**
The **base layer** (or **Layer 1**) refers to the foundational blockchain, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin, where transactions and smart contracts are processed.

### 7. **Layer 2**
**Layer 2** solutions are built on top of Layer 1 blockchains to improve scalability, speed, and cost-efficiency. For example, the Lightning Network is a Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin.

### 8. **Gas Limit**
The **gas limit** is the maximum amount of gas (or transaction fees) that a user is willing to pay for a transaction on a blockchain like Ethereum. Setting a higher gas limit can speed up transactions.
