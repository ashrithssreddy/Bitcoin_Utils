## Wallets - Types
Bitcoin wallets are essential for storing, sending, and receiving Bitcoin securely. Different types of wallets cater to varying needs for security and convenience.

### Hot vs. Cold Wallets
- **Hot Wallets**: Connected to the internet, making them convenient but more susceptible to attacks. Ideal for small, frequent transactions.
  ![Hot Wallet Example](
  - Examples: **Trust Wallet**, **MetaMask** (easy to set up and use, great for small amounts).
- **Cold Wallets**: Offline storage solutions, such as hardware wallets or paper wallets, providing better security for storing larger amounts.
  ![Cold Wallet Example](
  - Examples: **Ledger** and **Trezor** (designed for security, great for long-term storage).

### Restoring Wallets
Restoring a wallet involves using a **seed phrase** (usually 12 or 24 words). This phrase is the master key to your funds, so it's critical to store it securely. [How to Restore Your Wallet - Guide](

### Multi-Sig Wallets - What Are They?
**Multi-signature (multi-sig)** wallets require multiple private keys to authorize transactions. This is particularly useful for:
- Joint accounts, like a shared family wallet.
- Added protection against a single point of failure.

  For example, a wallet might require 2 of 3 signatures to approve a transaction, improving security.

### Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Wallets
- **Custodial Wallets**: A third party (e.g., an exchange) controls your keys. Convenient, but you rely on someone else for security. Think of it as using a bank.
  - Example: **Binance** or **Coinbase Wallet**.
- **Non-Custodial Wallets**: You control your keys, giving you full ownership. It’s akin to keeping cash in your own safe.
  - Example: **Exodus** or **Electrum** (where only you hold the keys).

## Choosing a Wallet
When choosing a wallet, consider factors like ease of use, security, and the intended purpose of the funds.

### Popular Apps - Examples
- **Hot Wallets**: Trust Wallet, MetaMask
- **Cold Wallets**: Ledger, Trezor
- **Mobile Wallets**: Cash App, BlueWallet

### Exchange vs. Wallet Difference
- **Exchange Wallet**: Provided by platforms like Binance. You don’t control the keys, and your funds are subject to the exchange’s terms and security.
- **True Wallet**: Lets you hold your own keys, ensuring full ownership and autonomy over your funds.

## Example Scenario
Imagine you just bought some Bitcoin:
1. **Hot Wallet**: Use it for small amounts and quick transactions, like paying for a coffee.
   - Example: Store 0.01 BTC on **Trust Wallet** for quick spending.
2. **Cold Wallet**: Use it for larger amounts that you intend to hold long-term.
   - Example: Store 0.5 BTC on **Ledger** for maximum security.
3. **Backup Seed Phrase**: Write down the seed phrase and keep it safe in multiple secure places. [Learn about Backup Strategies](

## Paper Wallets - Disposable Ones for Privacy
**Paper wallets** are physical documents that store your private keys. They are suitable for privacy-focused users wanting an offline, disposable wallet. However, they come with significant risks, such as:
- **Physical Damage**: Paper can be easily damaged.
- **Misplacement**: If lost or stolen, the funds are gone.
