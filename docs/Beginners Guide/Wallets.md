## Wallets - Types
Bitcoin wallets are essential for storing, sending, and receiving Bitcoin securely. There are different types of wallets, each with its unique features and security considerations.

### Hot vs. Cold Wallets
- **Hot Wallets**: These are connected to the internet, making them convenient but more susceptible to attacks. Suitable for daily use and small amounts.
- **Cold Wallets**: These are offline storage solutions, such as hardware wallets or paper wallets, providing higher security for larger amounts.

### Restoring Wallets
Restoring a wallet typically involves using a seed phrase (usually 12 or 24 words). It's crucial to keep this phrase safe as it can fully recover the wallet in case of loss or theft.

### Multi-Sig Wallets - What Are They?
Multi-signature (multi-sig) wallets require multiple private keys to authorize a transaction, adding an additional layer of security. These wallets are often used for joint accounts or added protection for individuals.

### Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Wallets
- **Custodial Wallets**: Your private keys are held by a third party (e.g., an exchange). They are convenient but less secure because you rely on a third party.
- **Non-Custodial Wallets**: You control your private keys, giving you full control over your funds. These wallets are considered more secure but require the user to be responsible for managing private keys.

## Choosing a Wallet
When choosing a wallet, itâ€™s important to consider your specific needs, such as ease of use, security, and frequency of transactions.

### Popular Apps - Examples
- **Hot Wallets**: Trust Wallet, MetaMask
- **Cold Wallets**: Ledger, Trezor
- **Mobile Wallets**: Cash App, BlueWallet

### Exchange vs. Wallet Difference
Exchanges like Binance or Coinbase provide wallets, but they are custodial. A true wallet allows you to hold your own keys, providing full ownership and security of your funds.

## Example Scenario
Imagine you want to store some Bitcoin you just purchased. You could:
1. Set up a hot wallet for immediate use, like making small purchases.
2. Store the majority in a cold wallet for added security.
3. Back up the seed phrase for restoring in case of device loss.

## Wallet Security Best Practices
Keeping your wallet secure is critical to avoid loss of funds. Here are some best practices:

- Use **hardware wallets** for significant amounts.
- Avoid sharing your private keys with anyone.
- Enable **two-factor authentication** (2FA) where applicable.
- **Backup strategies**: Create multiple copies of your seed phrase and store them in secure locations. Learn more about backup strategies [here](https://example.com/backup-strategies).

## Paper Wallets - Disposable Ones for Privacy
Paper wallets are physical documents that contain your private keys. They can be a good way to store Bitcoin offline, but require careful handling to avoid loss or theft.
