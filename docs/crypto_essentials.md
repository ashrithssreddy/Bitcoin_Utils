# Crypto Essentials: A Practical Guide for Everyday Users

## Must Know

### 1. **Blockchain** (Also known as: Distributed Ledger)
A decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers. Every transaction is added as a "block" in a chain, hence the name.

### 2. **Wallet** (Also known as: Digital Wallet, Crypto Wallet)
A digital tool used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrency. Wallets can be hardware-based (physical devices) or software-based (apps).

### 3. **Private Key** (Also known as: Secret Key, Private Code)
A secure code that allows you to access and manage your cryptocurrency. **Never share your private key with anyone**.

### 4. **Public Key** (Also known as: Wallet Address, Receiving Address)
An address that others can use to send cryptocurrency to you. It’s like your bank account number.

### 5. **Exchange** (Also known as: Crypto Exchange, Trading Platform)
A platform where you can buy, sell, or trade cryptocurrencies. Examples include Binance, Coinbase, and ZebPay.

### 6. **Fiat Currency** (Also known as: Traditional Currency, Government-Issued Money)
Traditional government-issued currency like the US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), or Indian Rupee (INR).

### 7. **Stablecoin** (Also known as: Pegged Cryptocurrency)
Cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of traditional fiat currencies, like USDC or USDT, maintaining a stable value, typically 1:1 with the US dollar.

### 8. **Gas Fee** (Also known as: Transaction Fee, Network Fee)
A small fee paid to process transactions on a blockchain, particularly on Ethereum. Gas fees compensate miners or validators for securing the network.

### 9. **Transaction Hash (TxID)** (Also known as: Transaction ID)
A unique identifier for each transaction on a blockchain. It can be used to track the status of your crypto transfer.

### 10. **Seed Phrase** (Also known as: Recovery Phrase, Backup Phrase)
A series of words that allows you to recover your crypto wallet if it's lost. **Keep this safe** and never share it.

### 11. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** (Also known as: Multi-Factor Authentication)
An added layer of security that requires not just a password but also a secondary verification (like a text message code) to access an account.

## Good to Know

### 1. **Altcoin** (Also known as: Alternative Coin, Non-Bitcoin Crypto)
Any cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin. Examples include Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC).

### 2. **Cold Storage** (Also known as: Offline Storage, Hardware Wallet Storage)
Storing your cryptocurrency offline, typically using a hardware wallet, for enhanced security.

### 3. **Hot Wallet** (Also known as: Online Wallet)
A cryptocurrency wallet that is connected to the internet. While convenient for frequent transactions, it is more vulnerable to hacking compared to cold storage.

### 4. **Mining** (Also known as: Bitcoin Mining, Proof of Work)
The process by which new cryptocurrency is generated and transactions are verified on a blockchain. Miners solve complex math problems to secure the network.

### 5. **Staking** (Also known as: Proof of Stake, Crypto Staking)
The process of participating in a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain by locking up your coins to support the network and earn rewards.

### 6. **Token** (Also known as: Crypto Token, Digital Token)
A type of cryptocurrency that represents an asset or utility, often created on existing blockchains like Ethereum.

### 7. **ERC-20 Token**
A standard used on the Ethereum blockchain for creating tokens. USDC and many other tokens follow this standard.

### 8. **Proof of Work (PoW)** 
A consensus mechanism that requires miners to solve computational puzzles to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain (used by Bitcoin).

### 9. **Proof of Stake (PoS)**
A consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.

### 10. **Smart Contract** (Also known as: Self-Executing Contract)
A self-executing contract with the terms directly written into lines of code. It automates transactions on a blockchain.

## Great to Know

### 1. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** (Also known as: Open Finance)
Financial services (like lending or trading) that run on blockchain technology without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks.

### 2. **NFT (Non-Fungible Token)** (Also known as: Digital Collectible, Unique Token)
A type of digital asset that represents ownership of a unique item, such as art, music, or collectibles.

### 3. **Fork** (Also known as: Blockchain Fork, Hard Fork, Soft Fork)
When a blockchain splits into two separate chains due to differences in the network’s rules. A famous example is the split between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

### 4. **Liquidity** (Also known as: Market Liquidity)
The ease with which a cryptocurrency can be bought or sold without affecting its price. High liquidity means easier transactions.

### 5. **Dapp (Decentralized Application)**
Applications that run on blockchain networks (like Ethereum) rather than on centralized servers.

### 6. **Base Layer (Layer 1)** 
The foundational layer of a blockchain, like Ethereum or Bitcoin, where transactions and smart contracts are processed.

### 7. **Layer 2**
Solutions built on top of Layer 1 blockchains to improve scalability, speed, and cost-efficiency (e.g., Lightning Network on Bitcoin).

### 8. **Gas Limit** 
The maximum amount of gas (or transaction fees) a user is willing to pay for a transaction on the Ethereum network.
